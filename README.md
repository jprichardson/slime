slime
=====

Easy Node.js REPL for your projects.


Why?
----

The current Node.js REPL doesn't do enough. It can be tedious to include your own modules over and over for your projects. `slime` does this for you automatically and throws in some ES6 goodness.


Installation
------------

    npm install -g slime
